# Decisions

## Architecture

### Why ViteJS?

- **ViteJS enables rapid development** by employing an efficient build process and supporting native ES modules, leading to quicker bundling and faster refresh times during development.
- **ViteJS incorporates built-in TypeScript integration**, aiding in identifying and addressing potential bugs for a more robust codebase.
- **This project primarily serves as a proof of concept (POC) rather than a user-oriented application**. Therefore, opting for a less complex approach without technologies like NextJS is preferable.

## Design & Styling

### Why Chakra UI?

This choice is based on 3 main factors:

- The desire to **discover** a new UI Library
- Chakra UI Design System fits better with the **original application design** we are cloning
- The **challenge** of creating an application with a new, not yet mastered stack to improve skill flexibility and adaptability
